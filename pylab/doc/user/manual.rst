Plot
=====

In order to to a simple 2D plot, create some x and y data (here the PyLabRandom node) and connect them to the first and second PyLabPlot connector. the two entries must have the same length. Then run the PyLabPlot node. By default, the marker are blue circles as shown here below, and the linestyle is solid. To remove the lines between each point double click on the Plot node and select nothin in place of solid.
