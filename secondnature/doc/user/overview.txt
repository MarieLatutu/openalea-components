SecondNature is the code name for a program that tries to agglomerate, expose and consolidate
developments happening at VirtualPlants.

The main point of this experiment is to let us define an extension API and a UI paradigm that
allows for the flexibility we are aiming for.

Its first goal is to merge OpenAlea and LPy in the same interface and let them share resources.
